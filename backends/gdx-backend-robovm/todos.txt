General
	- see issue tracker, RoboVM specific issues are marked with [RoboVM]
	- OGG is currently not supported by ObjectAL

- IOSApplication.java
	- getVersion(), getJavaHeap(), getNativeHeap() not implemented
	- getClipboard() not implemented properly, should at least support strings
	- 
- IOSApplicationConfiguration
	- add compass
	- add useGL2, requires implementation of GL10/GL11 for ios, and fixes in IOSGraphics
- IOSAudo
	- newAudioDevice(), new AudioRecorder() not implemented
	- OGG not supported, see if we can add that to ObjectAL
- IOSFileHandle, IOSFiles
	- check if paths for internal, external, local are correct and working as intended
- IOSGraphics
	- need to store current device orientation for Input#getOrienation and consorts
	- GLKView, is this supported from IOS 5+ onwards? i guess we can make that our minimum iOS version
	- Add support for GL10/GL11	
	- check if apps supporting both portrait and landscape work (resize, etc.) 
	- implement non-continuous rendering
- IOSInput
	- getRotation() needs to be implemented
	- getNativeOrientation() needs to be implemented, see IOSInput
	- getAzimuth(), getPitch(), getRoll(), getRotationMatrix() need to be implemented and output the same as android
	- vibrate(), cancelVibrate() needs to be implemented
	- see if we can programmatically show the keyboard and receive key events, if so map to gdx keycodes
	- getPlaceholderTextInput() needs to be implemented		
	- add compass support, fix up isPeripheralAvailable(), including onscreen keyboard stuff
	
- IOSMusic
	- OGG support
- IOSNet
	- check if that actually works as intended
- IOSSound
	- add support for manipulating an already playing sound instance, seems to work through ALSource
	- add support for pitch shifting, not sure ObjectAL can do that
